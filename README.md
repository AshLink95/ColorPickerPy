A python script for RGB color visualization

# Purpose
ColorPickerPy is a simple and light script that instantly shows colors based on the RGB values you choose using 3 sliders, one for each of the 3 main values which are Red, Green and Blue.

Note that sliders are adaptible to the window's width, meaning that the ratio of the current value to the maximum value is always preserved.
